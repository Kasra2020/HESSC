# Hierarchical Sparse Subspace Clustering (HESSC)

HESSC is a Matlab toolbox, which includes a sparse-based clustering algorithm for hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. This toolbox supports a journal paper accepted in Remote Sensing entitled "Hierarchical Sparse Subspace Clustering (HESSC): An Automatic Approach for Hyperspectral Image Analysis".

The paper provides an automatic clustering algorithm to cluster an HSI into meaningful groups.
Besides, the manual version of HESSC is also existed in this toolbox, in the case of knowing the number of clusters prior to the analysis procedure.
