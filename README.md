# Hierarchical Sparse Subspace Clustering (HESSC)
# HESSC is a Matlab toolbox, which includes a sparse-based clustering algorithm for hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. This toolbox supports a journal paper accepted 
# in Remote Sensing entitled "Hierarchical Sparse Subspace Clustering (HESSC): An Automatic Approach for Hyperspectral Image Analysis". The link to the paper:

# The paper provides an automatic clustering algorithm to cluster an HSI into meaningful groups.
# Besides, the manual version of HESSC is also existed in this toolbox, in the case of knowing the number of clusters prior to the analysis procedure.
